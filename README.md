**Overview**

This project is a simple library management system written in Java. 
It allows users to perform various operations such as listing all books, listing available books, borrowing books, and returning books. 
The project is structured into several classes: App, Book, Library, and AppTest for unit testing.

The main goal here was to practice unit testing in java using JUnit.

The main code was made by Erno Vanhala for the course CT60A4160 Ohjelmistotestauksen periaatteet
My contribution is the AppTest.java class.
The code shows my ability to use JUnit framework to conduct basic unit test.
